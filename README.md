# WorshipON (worshipon)
WorshipON will be a world-wide worship app providing an easy entry for artists to share content that glorifies Jesus Christ in their own languages, and the opportunity for any one to listen and worship Him.Meanwhile, worship leaders can download content to use in worship services.

Eventually, we are looking to have a platform that also enables chats, pod casts, and videos.

# installation

This project has been initiated following the same steps laid out on https://medium.com/quasar-framework/creating-a-quasar-framework-application-with-aws-amplify-services-part-1-4-9a795f38e16d

So not repeating the Amplify steps here. If you want to initiate the amplify build, you will need an AWS account and follow the instructions for initiating amplify.  It will cost you approximately $1/day it running.


## Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```

### Lint the files
```bash
npm run lint
```

### Build the app for dev on AWS
```bash
amplify configure (follow steps above)
amplify init
amplify push
amplify publish
```

### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.conf.js](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js).
